            <p>
              My Halloween Park is a virtual Halloween park simulation game
              designed for entertainment purposes only. The game features
              various spooky attractions, ghost collection mechanics, and
              haunted house management that are purely fictional and created for
              gaming purposes.

            <h2>Not Real Park Management</h2>
            <p>
              This game is not intended to serve as real amusement park
              management instruction or training. The park management
              techniques, ghost collection scenarios, and attraction behaviors
              depicted in the game are simplified simulations and should not be
              considered as accurate representations of real-world park
              operations or business practices.
